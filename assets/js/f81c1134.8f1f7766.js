Whether you\'re a developer, a creative, or simply someone who loves to take notes, Noorg was designed with one core principle: **focus on capturing ideas, not organizing them**.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **Why Noorg?** \ud83e\udd14\\n\\nTraditional note-taking systems often demand meticulous organization, rigid hierarchies, and time-consuming curation. Noorg is here to liberate you from these constraints. Inspired by the philosophy of **\\"just write it down\\"**, Noorg shifts the focus from organization to effortless **capture** and **processing**.\\n\\nImagine being able to:\\n- Write freely in any editor of your choice (Vim, Emacs, VSCode, Obsidian\u2014you name it).\\n- Automatically annotate and process notes using **dynamic metadata**.\\n- Extend functionality with powerful integrations written in **Python, Lua, and Rust**.\\n- Focus on what matters most: your ideas.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **Who Is Noorg For?** \ud83c\udf1f\\n\\nNoorg is for everyone who wants a tool that adapts to their workflows rather than the other way around. It\u2019s ideal for:\\n- Developers who prefer working in their favorite editors.\\n- Writers who need a system that doesn\u2019t get in the way of creativity.\\n- Knowledge workers tired of rigid folder structures and endless tagging.\\n- Hobbyists who want to experiment with automation and integrations.\\n\\n:warning: **Note**: Noorg is currently in **pre-alpha**, so expect bugs and instability. Your feedback is crucial to shaping its future. Also it is only available for MacOS currently.\\n---\\n\\n## **What Makes Noorg Special?** \u2728\\n\\n### **Editor-Agnostic and Seamless Integration** \ud83d\udd17\\nNoorg is not tied to any specific editor, meaning you can use it with your favorite tools. Write in Markdown, enrich your notes with frontmatter metadata, and let Noorg handle the rest.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Dynamic Observers** \ud83d\udc40\\nLeveraging the **observer pattern**, Noorg provides real-time note processing without breaking your flow. For instance:\\n- A **time tracker** monitors how much time you spend on topics.\\n- **Inline tags** dynamically create a tagging system.\\n- Observers can even generate a daily journal or tag notes based on content.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Extensible Runtime** \ud83d\udd27\\nAt its heart, Noorg is a highly extensible runtime. Want to customize it? Use **Python**, **Lua**, or **Rust** to build your own note-processing workflows, from automatic tagging to complex data integrations. The possibilities are endless:\\n- Create **Kanban boards** for project tracking.\\n- Automate **time tracking** and **task prioritization**.\\n- Develop custom **dynamic views** with SQL-like queries.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Offline-First and Free** \ud83c\udf10\\nNoorg respects your privacy and autonomy. It\u2019s fully offline, with no cloud dependencies, free, and open source. Your notes stay with you, and the community drives its growth.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **Use Cases: What Can You Do with Noorg?** \ud83d\udca1\\n\\n1. **Dynamic Journaling**: Automatically compile a daily journal from your notes.\\n2. **Kanban Boards**: Organize tasks visually.\\n3. **Tagging Systems**: Use inline tags to categorize and create dynamic note views.\\n4. **Time Tracking**: Monitor your focus and productivity.\\n5. **Custom Automation**: Build workflows with Python, Lua, or Rust, such as integrating APIs or generating reports.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **Why Noorg Was Created** \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f\\n\\nNoorg was born out of frustration with overly complex note-taking systems. It\u2019s for the thinkers who just want to capture their thoughts without the cognitive overhead of organizing them. It\'s for those who value simplicity, adaptability, and innovation in their tools.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **Caution: Pre-Alpha Stage** \u26a0\ufe0f\\n\\nNoorg is currently in **pre-alpha**, which means it\u2019s powerful but still evolving. Bugs and instability may occur, so we encourage you to experiment cautiously and back up your data. Your feedback will help shape Noorg into the ultimate note-taking platform.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **Join the Noorg Community** \ud83e\udd1d\\n\\nNoorg is **free**, **open source**, and **community-driven**. We believe in building tools together that empower people to think freely and creatively.
